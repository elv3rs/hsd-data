No remaining actionable items — the project fully meets SPECIFICATION.md
for all non-optional features (HSD, XML, JSON, TOML backends; unified API;
CLI tool; comprehensive tests).  HDF5 backend is deferred (optional Phase 6).

## Recursive Task Directive

> Once all items above are exhausted, **replenish** a couple of new actionable
> points by considering the current project state and surveying
> `SPECIFICATION.md` and the codebase. Keep this directive at the **bottom** of
> the TODO list. Resume working through the list sequentially.
>
> **Stop condition:** no further actionable points can be generated because the
> project state fully meets `SPECIFICATION.md`.
