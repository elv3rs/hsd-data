- Extend the TOML-specific cross-format test to cover more fixtures
  (nested, arrays, attributes, etc.) now that TOML fixture files exist
  for all test patterns.
- Update AGENTS.md project layout section to include `hsd_data_json_escape.f90`
  and `hsd_data_toml.f90` for accuracy.

## Recursive Task Directive

> Once all items above are exhausted, **replenish** a couple of new actionable
> points by considering the current project state and surveying
> `SPECIFICATION.md` and the codebase. Keep this directive at the **bottom** of
> the TODO list. Resume working through the list sequentially.
>
> **Stop condition:** no further actionable points can be generated because the
> project state fully meets `SPECIFICATION.md`.
